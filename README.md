# README for gcd_final 

This is my repo for the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera.

The files within this repo are as follows:

1. README.md is this file, which communicates the uses of each file within this repo

2. run_analysis.R is the file for running the analysis.  Working directory must be set to one level above the 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory. 

3. code_book.Rmd is the RMarkdown file directly from RStudio (not the .md file)

4. code_book.pdf is a PDF knit of the original RMarkdown file

5. code_book.md is the Markdown file rendered for GitHub (use this one!)
